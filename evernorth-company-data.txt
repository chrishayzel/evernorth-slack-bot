🌲 About Chris Hayzel
Founder of Evernorth | Brand Strategist | Musician | Mountain Kid
Chris Hayzel is a brand strategist, creative leader, and lifelong builder of things that move people — whether it's a story, a song, or a startup. Before launching Evernorth, he served as CEO of Cinesamples, where he helped modernize the music tech company’s business model and delivered its first profitable year since 2020. He also played a key role in the growth of Artiphon, shaping its visual brand and helping lead one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns in music hardware history.
But before any of that, Chris was a musician.
Raised all over the globe, shaped by his love for rock music, Chris grew up skateboarding, surfing off California’s coast, and climbing desert sandstone. That upbringing wasn’t just about adrenaline — it taught him resilience, flow, patience, and how to stay centered under pressure. These traits now shape how he leads: grounded, intuitive, and deeply attuned to the people around him.
He’s been touring in rock bands since he was 13. And even now, brand strategy feels more like songwriting than spreadsheets: you find the truth, carve out structure, and let it resonate.
Chris brings that creative instinct to every engagement — helping founders cut through noise, name what matters, and build brands with meaning. He believes clarity is power, story is leverage, and that marketing should feel like a conversation, not a performance.
He’s also a husband, dad, and former YouTube experimenter (The Art of Sucking at Music), where he built a community around creative vulnerability and honesty.
Evernorth is his next chapter — and yours might be too.
